console.log('hello')

/*
    Overall steps;
    -add a game start feature 
        -could be through a promp screen or have a button start the game.
    -usually let the players put the ship in their desired locations. 
     Ill probably have that process automated instead.
    -have the users select input based on a 10x10 grid. 
     have the input gird position indicate if the player hit a ship.
    -have the player sink all the ships in order to win the game.
    -have a winner screen 
    My general idea on steps i will do first:
    -create the grid first 
    -figure out how to auto generate the ships on the board
    -have a turn system until a winner is decided 
    -make a winner screen
